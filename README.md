# Uncommon Tailwind CSS JIT Mode Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using Tailwind CSS's Just-In-Time (JIT) mode.  These errors are often subtle and difficult to debug.

**Issues Covered:**

* Conflicting directives (`@apply` vs. direct class application)
* Typos or incorrect paths in `tailwind.config.js`
* Conflicting custom variants
* Problems with the `content` option (previously `purge`)

Each example includes the buggy code and its corrected version.  The goal is to illustrate these issues and provide solutions for better Tailwind CSS development.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to each example directory.
3. Run the provided build commands (if any).
4. Observe the rendered output and compare the buggy version with the corrected version.
