To solve the issues with the JIT mode, carefully review your `tailwind.config.js` file for typos, ensure the paths to your template files are correctly specified in the `content` array, and avoid conflicting directives.  For example, if you're applying a style using `@apply`, avoid applying the same style directly using classes. If using custom variants, double check to ensure that they don't conflict with the default Tailwind variants.   Always make sure you have a proper build process that incorporates the Tailwind compilation step. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the generated CSS and check for missing styles or unexpected behavior.   For older projects using the `purge` option (now deprecated), migrate it to the `content` option by updating the config file to specify the correct paths to your template files.
