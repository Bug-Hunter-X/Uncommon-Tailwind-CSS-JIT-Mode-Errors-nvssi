The Tailwind CSS JIT mode can sometimes produce unexpected results if there are errors in your configuration or if you are using conflicting directives.  For example, using both `@apply` and direct class application for the same style could lead to unexpected behavior.  Another problem can arise if there are typos or incorrect paths in your Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`). This can lead to styles not being applied correctly or errors during the build process.  Also, using custom variants that conflict with default ones can cause problems.   Improperly configured `purge` (now `content`) option in older versions of Tailwind can also lead to unexpected CSS output, with some classes being dropped unexpectedly.
